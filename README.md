# sleep-quality-prediction-with-feedback-loop
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts sleep quality based on various sleep-related factors. The model is trained on a dataset that includes information such as steps taken, alarm usage, time spent in bed, time asleep, time before sleep, and snoring incidents. The model uses a Random Forest algorithm to make predictions.
